# Welcome to Project eXpOS!

Project eXpOS (eXperimental Operating System) is an online educational platform designed to assist undergraduate students in understanding the intricacies of operating systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive guide for students, offering a detailed project roadmap that enables them to build a small operating system from scratch. By following the step-by-step guidance, students delve into the implementation of various OS data structures and kernel routines, thereby gaining a comprehensive understanding of operating system architecture.

The included machine simulator allows students to run their self-developed operating system, providing a practical environment for testing and experimentation. The project is tailored for individuals who have completed a course in computer organization and possess a strong foundation in programming.
