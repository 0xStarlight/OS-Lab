# Welcome to Project eXpOS!

Project [eXpOS](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/) (eXperimental Operating System) is an online educational platform designed to assist undergraduate students in understanding the intricacies of operating systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive guide for students, offering a detailed project roadmap that enables them to build a small operating system from scratch. By following the step-by-step guidance, students delve into the implementation of various OS data structures and kernel routines, thereby gaining a comprehensive understanding of operating system architecture.

The included machine simulator allows students to run their self-developed operating system, providing a practical environment for testing and experimentation. The project is tailored for individuals who have completed a course in computer organization and possess a strong foundation in programming.

This repository contains comprehensive notes and solutions for the various stages of the Project eXpOS. These notes have been prepared to aid in the preparation of the viva, with modifications and insights for all stages of the project. Intermediate stages introduce advanced hardware features and kernel subsystems, while the final stages focus on implementing system calls as per the ABI documentation. We encourage you to leverage these resources to navigate the complexities of operating system development.

## Stages Overview
- Stages 1 to 12: Cover the fundamental aspects of OS development, including filesystem, SPL language, debugging, and more.
- Stages 13 to 19: Introduce advanced hardware features and basic kernel subsystems for resource and memory management, alongside the implementation of a primitive user interface.
- Stages 20 to 28: Focus on implementing system calls, process synchronization, file system, multi-user support, and virtual memory. An advanced stage also describes the porting of the OS to a two-core extension of the XSM machine.

Explore the repository to access detailed notes for each stage, providing valuable insights into the intricacies of operating system design and implementation.
