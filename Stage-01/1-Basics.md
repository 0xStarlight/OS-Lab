# What is an OS?

An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an interface between the computer hardware and the user, allowing the user to interact with the computer and run applications. The OS is responsible for managing system resources such as memory, processing power, and storage, as well as providing services such as file management, security, and networking. Examples of popular operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# What is a kernel?

A kernel is a fundamental component of an operating system. It acts as a bridge between software and hardware, managing system resources and providing essential services such as process management, memory management, and device drivers. The kernel is responsible for facilitating communication between different parts of the operating system and handling system calls from user programs.
