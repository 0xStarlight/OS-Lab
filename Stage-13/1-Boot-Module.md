Modules in eXpOS are used to perform certain logical tasks, which are performed frequently. eXpOS modules serve various purposes like scheduling new process, acquiring and releasing resources etc. These modules run in kernel mode and are invoked only from the kernel mode. A user program can never invoke a module directly. Modules can be invoked from interrupt routines, other modules or the OS startup code.

As modules execute in kernel mode, the kernel stack of the currently scheduled process is used as the caller-stack for module invocation. XSM supports eight modules - `MOD_0` to `MOD_7` - which can be invoked using the `CALL MOD_n` / `CALL <module_name>` instruction (see [SPL constants](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/support-tools/constants/#spl-constants-defining-the-call-addresses-for-interruptsexceptionsmodules)).While switching to module, the CALL instruction pushes the IP address of the instruction following the `CALL` instruction on the top of the kernel stack and starts execution of the corresponding module. A module returns to the caller using the RET instruction (return statement in SPL) which restores the IP value present on the top of the kernel stack, pushed earlier by the CALL instruction. Note that we use the return statement, instead of the ireturn statement, to return to the caller. The `IRET` instruction (ireturn statement) changes mode from kernel to user as it assumes that SP contains a logical address. The RET instruction (return statement) on the other hand just returns to the caller in kernel mode, using the IP value pointed by SP. Read about kernel stack management during kernel module calls [here](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-design/stack-module/).

A module in eXpOS may implement several functions, each for a particular task ( eg- [resource manager module](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/modules/module-00/) -module 0).Some modules may perform a single task (eg- scheduler, boot module). For a module with several functions, each function is given a function number to distinguish them within the module. This function number should be passed as argument in the register R1 along with other arguments in R2, R3 etc. Register R0 is reserved for return value. See [SPL module calling conventions](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/support-tools/spl/) for details.For details about the OS functions implemented in various eXpOS modules, see [here](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/modules/).

According to the [memory organization](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-implementation/) of eXpOS, the OS startup code is provided with only one memory page (page numer 1). However, the code for OS startup may exceed one page due to initialization of several OS data structures. So we design a module for the purpose of OS initialization. This module will be called the **Boot module**(module 7). The Boot module is invoked from the OS startup code. The OS startup code hand-creates the idle process, initializes the SP register to the kernel stack of the idle process, loads module 7 in memory and then invokes the boot module (using the stack of the IDLE process). Upon return from the boot module, the OS startup code initiates user mode execution of the idle process. Note that in the previous stage, we had scheduled the INIT process first, before executing the IDLE pocess. Starting from the present stage, the idle process will be scheduled first. All further scheduling of processes will be controlled by the timer interrupt routine and a scheduler module, which will be discussed in the next stage. The Boot module is responsible for initialization of all eXpOS data structures, user processes and also loading of all interrupt routines and modules. You will not modify the OS startup code written in this stage in subsequent stages. However, you will add more code to the boot module as you go through various stages of the roadmap.

The idle process is run first to ensure that this process is scheduled at least once, so that its context gets initialized. This useful because in later stages, certain kernel operations (like disk swap) are performed from the context of the IDLE process. For now, we skip over this matter.

#### Modifications to OS startup code[¶](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/roadmap/stage-13/#modifications-to-os-startup-code "Permanent link")

1) Load module 7 from disk blocks 67 and 68 to memory pages 54 and 55 respectively, also load idle process from the [disk](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-implementation/#disk-organization)to the corresponding [memory pages](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-implementation/#memory-organization).

2) Set SP to (user area page number) * 512 -1. The user area page number for the idle process is 82 (as decided in the previous stage). This sets up a stack for calling the boot module.

3) Call module 7 (boot module) using call statement in SPL.

```nasm
call BOOT_MODULE;
```

/ _The following code is executed after return from the boot module_ /

4) Setup the page table entries for the idle process as was done in the previous stage. Also set up PTBR to the page table base of the idle process. (The SPL constant PAGE_TABLE_BASE will point to the start of the page table of the idle process - figure out why.) Initialize PTLR (all user process in eXpOS must have PTLR=10).

5) Initialize PID, UPTR, KPTR, PTBR, PTLR and user area page number fields in the [Process Table](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-design/process-table/) entry for the idle process as was done in the previous stage.

6) As the idle process is scheduled first, initialize the STATE field in the process table entry of the idle process as RUNNING and current PID field in the [System Status Table](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/os-design/mem-ds/#system-status-table) to 0 (PID of the idle process).

7) Transfer the entry point value from the header of the idle process to the top of the user stack of the idle process, as was done in the previous stage.

8)Set the SP to the logical address of the user stack (8*512).

9) Switch to the user mode using the ireturn statement.

#### Boot module[¶](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/roadmap/stage-13/#boot-module "Permanent link")

1. Load all the required interrupts routines, eXpOS library, exception handler and the INIT process from the disk to the memory as was done in the OS startup code of the previous stage.
2. Set the page table entries for INIT process as was done in the previous stage.
3. Initialize the process table entry for the INIT process (setting PID, UPTR, KPTR, PTLR, PTBR, user area page number etc.) as was done in the previous stage.
4. Set the STATE field in the process table entry of INIT to CREATED. (INIT will not be scheduled immedietely, as the idle process is going to be scheduled first.)
5. Transfer the entry point value from the header of the INIT process to the top of the user stack of the INIT process, as was done in the previous stage.
6. Return from module to OS startup code using return statement in SPL.

#### Making things work[¶](https://exposnitc.github.io/expos-docs/roadmap/stage-13/#making-things-work "Permanent link")

Compile and load module 7 and the modified OS startup code to the disk using XFS interface. Run the XSM machine with timer enabled.

# Assignment 1
```ad-question
Write ExpL programs to print even and odd numbers below 100. Modify the boot module code and the timer interrupt handler to schedule the two processes along with the idle process concurrently using the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.
```

---

# Assignment 2
```ad-question
In the program of the previous assignment, add a _breakpoint_immediately upon entering the timer interrupt handler and print out in debug mode the contents of the page table entry and the process table entry of the current process (that is, the process from which timer was entered). You need to use use _p_ and _pt_ options of xsm debugger. Add another _breakpoint_just before return from the timer interrupt handler to print out the same contents.
